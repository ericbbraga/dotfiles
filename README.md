# dotfiles
This is my personal configuration for some applications (as vim, compton, i3
and so). Those configurations are not definitine because I really like to 
change a lit bit when I discovery a new vim plugins or a new configurations that help me in my job. 
Fell free to download it and send to me an interesting new configuration.
